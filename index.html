<p> I am currently working as a Lead Research Engineer at Siemens India, Bengaluru. I am exploring blockchain based solution for baggage tracking in airport along with a baggage tracking company owned by Siemens called <a href="https://www.axit.de/en">AXIT</a>. Earlier, I was working as a researcher for an year at <a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk">Computer Laboratory, University of Cambridge</a> with <a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~as2330/">Arjuna Sathiaseelan</a>, as a member of <a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~as2330/n4d/">N4D Lab</a>. Before joining this Lab, I was working with TCS Research as a Researcher in Network and Embedded systems group for an year (July 2016 - July 2017). At TCS, I worked on research problems related to LTE for IoT and robotic communications. I did my Master's in communication engineering from Department of Electrical Engineering, IIT Bombay graduating in 2016. At IITB, I was associated with <a href="http://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/pclab">PC Lab</a> and worked as a system administrator of the Dept. At IIT Bombay, I was also associated with <a href="http://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/~infonet">InfoNet Lab</a> and work as a research assistant (RA) with <a href="http://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/~karandi">Prof. Abhay Karandikar</a>. Earlier, I obtained my Bachelors degree in Electronics and Communications Engineering from <a href="http://www.sit.ac.in">Siddaganga Institute of Technology</a>, Tumkur in 2011. I then worked with <a href="http://www.huawei.com/in/">Huawei Technologies India Pvt. Ltd.</a> for an year and 3 months from july 2011 to November 2012. At Huawei, I was part of OSS-BSS team. I worked on inventory management, order management and provisioning of services in telecom networks.</p>
