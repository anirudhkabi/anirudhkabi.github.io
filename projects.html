<p> <b> Software defined networking(SDN) based controller for Wireless LAN</b></br> 
<i> M. Tech Project, Guide: Prof. Abhay Karandikar (June 2015 - June 2016) </i> </br>
o Worked as an equal member of a five person team to implement a WLAN Controller that uses CAPWAP tunnel to communicate with APs(access points) running Openwrt.<br/>
o Implemented applications at controller to communicate with AP following  IEEE 802.11 and CAPWAP RFC bindings.<br/>
o Designed and architecture for SDN based WLAN controller.<br/>
o Setup WLAN testbed and demonstrated a prototype of SDN based WLAN controller.<br/>
o Contributed towards standardisation of protocol for central management of WLAN by proposing and working on work item in TSDSI.<br/>
o My thesis was extnded further to be proposed and accepted as PAR in IEEE SDN group as <a href="https://standards.ieee.org/develop/project/1930.1.html">P1930.1</a>. I am currently contributing to the standard as a work group member<br/>
