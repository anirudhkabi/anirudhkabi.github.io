	Kernel type -> High Resolution Timer Support -> Timer frequency 1000 HZ

4. Download the file http://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~vsevani/phd/ath9k/compat-wireless-2010-03-24.tar.bz2.gpg

5. Decrypt the file using the command

	gpg compat-wireless-2010-03-24.tar.bz2.gpg

The password to be used for decryption was sent in the mail.

6. Copy the file compat-wireless-2010-03-24.tar.bz2 in the folder backfire_10.03/dl on your local machine

7. Download the file http://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~vsevani/phd/ath9k/Makefile and copy it in the folder backfire_10.03/package/mac80211 on your local machine.

8. Delete the contents of the folder backfire_10.03/package/mac80211/patches

	Target System -> Atheros AR71xx/AR7240/AR913x
	Target Profile -> Ubiquiti Products
	Target Images -> squashfs
	Kernel modules -> Wireless Drivers -> kmod-ath9k
	Kernel modules -> Wireless Drivers -> ath9k debugging
	Kernel modules -> Wireless Drivers -> use the new minstrel_ht rate control for ath9k
	Kernel modules -> Wireless Drivers -> Export mac80211 internals in DebugFS

10. Run make V=99 and the binaries for installing backfire will be generated in the folder backfire_10.03/bin/ar71xx/

11. For configuring the wifi interface, copy the file below in the folder /etc/rc.d/ on the bullet boards

	http://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~vsevani/phd/ath9k/S99sysctl

    Ensure that both root and non-root nodes have different IPs.

12. As mentioned do not create the file /etc/litmac.conf

13. Comment the line
